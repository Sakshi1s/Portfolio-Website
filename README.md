HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

HTML is the standard markup language used to structure content on the web. I have include tags that define the structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is a styling language that controls the presentation and layout of HTML elements. I applied styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to enhance the visual appearance of a webpage.

JavaScript (JS):

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic behavior on the client-side of a web application. Smooth scrolling is implemented for anchor links.
Hover animations are added to portfolio cards.


Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets):

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and functions, making stylesheets more maintainable and readable.
